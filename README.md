# FoGS

The folder 'Orbit calc' has a script titled 'sats_over_gs' that takes as input a url for TLE elements and produces information about each satellite station. For the purposes of our project, we are interested in determining when satellites pass over a ground station at a high enough elevation to record a pass. 

All functions needed for this calculation are activated by running the function loadLteFileStations('http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/active.txt')

Also included in this ReadMe folder 'datasets' are some datasets with information about which S-Band and X-Band satellites and ground stations are currently in operation.
